# SkyPay

**SkyPay** is a modular payment orchestration and settlement platform designed for cross-border commerce, emerging markets, and programmable finance.

SkyPay enables businesses, platforms, and institutions to **accept, route, settle, and reconcile payments across multiple rails** — including bank transfers, wallets, and digital assets — through a unified infrastructure.

---

## 🚀 Vision

To become the **universal payment orchestration layer** for Africa and emerging markets, connecting local payment methods, global liquidity, and programmable settlement logic.

SkyPay is **asset-agnostic by design** and supports both traditional and digital financial rails.

---

## 🧩 What SkyPay Is (and Is Not)

### ✅ SkyPay IS:
- A **payment orchestration engine**
- A **multi-rail settlement platform**
- A **merchant & enterprise payments infrastructure**
- A **real-time transaction and reconciliation system**
- A **compliance-aware payments backend**

### ❌ SkyPay is NOT:
- A single stablecoin product
- A speculative crypto protocol
- A replacement for banks or card networks

Digital assets are treated as **transport and settlement tools**, not as the core product.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

SkyPay is built as a modular system consisting of:

### Core Components
- **Backend API** – payment orchestration, routing, fees, compliance logic
- **WebSocket Server** – real-time transaction updates and notifications
- **Admin Dashboard** – operations, compliance, and settlement management
- **Web & Mobile Apps** – merchant and user interfaces
- **SDK** – developer integration layer
- **Smart Contracts (Optional Layer)** – programmable escrow and settlement logic
- **Ops & Infrastructure** – Dockerized deployment and services

---

## 🔗 Supported Settlement Assets

SkyPay supports multiple settlement asset types, including:

- Bank ledger balances
- Fiat-backed stablecoins (e.g. USD, EUR equivalents)
- Wallet balances
- Internal virtual accounts

> Native settlement assets and on-chain settlement are **optional modules**, activated based on regulatory approval and business requirements.

---

## 💼 Primary Use Cases

- Cross-border merchant payments
- B2B and B2C remittances
- Platform payouts and mass disbursements
- Marketplace escrow and settlements
- Treasury and liquidity routing
- Fintech-as-a-Service (FaaS)

---

## 🔐 Compliance & Risk

SkyPay is built with:
- Role-based access control
- Transaction monitoring hooks
- KYC/KYB integration readiness
- Audit trails and reconciliation layers

Compliance is treated as a **first-class system component**, not an afterthought.

---

## 🧠 Smart Contracts (Optional)

The `skypay-contracts` module provides:
- Escrow logic
- Role-based settlement
- Programmable fees
- Deterministic settlement rules

These contracts are **not required for day-to-day operations** and are activated only where on-chain settlement is appropriate.
